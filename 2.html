Schools are increasingly upgrading their education systems. However much of this effort is being directed towards improving the more visible aspects-better infrastructure and new technology.
<br />
Though these changes are clearly in the positive direction , are they enough to provide meaningful education that builds character and nurtures every childs potential to become to become the best he/she can be ?
<br />
Clearly education needs a metamorphosis and a change in the right direction. The present education , the tunnel of learning , must be converted to a process of enlightenment. From the Cocoon , a butterfly must emerge .</p>
